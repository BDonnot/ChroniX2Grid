Interface API
==============

In the workflow illustration below, each class, method and function is designed to be edited for your own generation models

Interface example
==================

Chronix2grid currently integrates a whole generation model (see :ref:`implemented-models` for full description of the algorithms).

Additionally, an alternative method has been interfaced for solar and wind generation with GAN based
on a `research paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09676>`_. TODO
